# Spam-Classification
In this I have classified whether the Email is Spam or Ham(not Spam). I have used various Machine Learning Algorithms and have compared the accuracy for the same.
The dataset which I have used can be found here https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/sms+spam+collection.
|               | Accuracy      |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| Naive Bayes   | 0.977578 | 
| Logistic Regression      | 0.966816     |   
| Random Forest | 0.968610      |  
| Decision Tree | 0.942601      | 
| Support Vector Machine | 0.983857     | 

From these results we can conclude that Support Vector Machine have got the highest accuracy on our dataset.
